    "Samsung Galaxy S23 FE tipped to arrive before the end of 2023",

    "David Nield",
    "We didn't get a Samsung Galaxy S22 FE last year, suggesting that Samsung had given up for good on the mid-range line – but there's a growing body of evidence hinting that the Fan Edition series will make a return with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE.

The latest twist in the story comes courtesy of SamMobile(opens in new tab). Its sources are saying that the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is indeed going to appear, and that it'll be powered exclusively by the Exynos 2200 processor.

That distinguishes it from the main Samsung Galaxy S23 line: all of those phones use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. The Exynos 2200 CPU was previously used for the Galaxy S22 phones from 2021 in certain parts of the world.

More specs
According to SamMobile, the Galaxy S23 FE is also going to come with a 50MP main camera lens on the back (matching the standard S23 model), and it's set to be offered with either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage.

Rounding out the rumored specs, we've got 6GB or 8GB of RAM, as well as a 4,500mAh capacity battery. That's the same battery size as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE that launched right at the start of 2022, the most recent Fan Edition handset.

As for the release window, it's said to be the fourth quarter of 2023 – October, November, or December. That would be close to two years after the last FE phone from Samsung, and it's success (or lack of it) will likely determine whether or not we get any more.",

     ["Google AirTags: why the incoming Apple rivals could take over the world",
    "./images/gt.jpg",
  "Mark Wilson ",
  "Apple's AirTags might be the world's most famous Bluetooth trackers, but they could soon have some Google rivals that connect to a huge Android equivalent of Apple's 'Find My' network. If that does materialize, it could be an incredibly powerful new way for Android fans to find lost possessions.

  Google's rumored AirTag rival – apparently codenamed Grogu, in a nod to fans of The Mandalorian – has been tipped for an announcement at Google I/O 2023, which kicks off on May 10. While the trackers may not arrive on shelves until later, it means Android users could soon see some rivals to the Tile Pro and Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus, along with a global object-finding network.
  
  But does the world really need more location trackers? After all, these little key fob-sized gadgets have courted as much controversy as they have praise. The Apple AirTag continues to hit the headlines despite anti-stalking firmware updates, while Tile also recently rolled out a controversial Anti-Theft Mode of its own." ,

     ["The best juicer 2023: the best cold press and centrifugal juicers you can buy","./images/ap1.jpg",
     "Jennifer Oksien",
     "The best juicers can create spectacular smoothies and other delicious drinks from pretty much anything. They're fantastic with fruit, of course, but they also make light work of even the toughest veggies. They're easy to use, great for healthy living and the drinks you'll make in them are better than even the freshest store-bought juice.
     When you're deciding which juicer to buy, there are two kinds to consider. Centrifugal juicers use spinning blades to get the juice out of fruits and veggies, while cold press juicers grind and strain the ingredients instead. Cold press juicers – sometimes called slow juicers or masticating juicers – tend to produce more juice from the same quantities, but they tend to cost more to buy.
     If you're looking to do more than just juicing, it's worth considering one of the best blenders instead. They're a bit more flexible and you can use them for fresh smoothies, soup or even cocktails. 
     So which one should you buy? We're glad you asked. We've tested all the big names such as Nutribullet, Smeg and Breville, as well as offerings from smaller names and from dedicated juicer brands too. Whether you're craving citrus or love something more leafy, these are the best juicers you can buy today.",

      "The best robot vacuum 2023: brilliant cleaning that saves you tons of time","./images/ap2.jpg",
      "Jennifer Oksien",
      "The best robot vacuum cleaners give you something invaluable: time. Time not spent cleaning carpets, refreshing rugs or washing wood is time you can spend doing something much more fun, and that's what these bots bring to your home. Not only do robo-vacs clean on your behalf; some of them even empty and clean themselves when they're done.
      Today's robotic household helpers are positively packed with cutting-edge tech. The newest models are smaller and more powerful than ever before, with advanced navigation systems to ensure they never miss an inch. Some also have sensors that enable them to skip past discarded socks and increase the suction power when they move from hard floors to carpet pile.
      While all the models here are brilliant, they're not necessarily capable of replacing the best vacuum cleaners completely if like us you have enthusiastically messy kids. And if you have pets, it might be wise to invest in one of the best robot vacuum cleaners for pet hair instead: even a medium-sized dog can shed more hair than a smaller vacuum can handle. However, for everyday cleaning that happens without any effort from you, robot vacuums are brilliant things. Coming home to a clean house is one of the great joys of home tech.
      Despite their many joys, the best robot vacuums can be quite pricey – although prices are definitely coming down. So to ensure you get the most cleaning bang for your bucks, we've tested eight of the leading models in our own homes to really put them through their paces. We've put all their key features to the test – runtime, suction power, mapping and automation capabilities and more – to help you find the best robot vacuum for you and your home.",

    "Axel Metz",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S23 line may have only come to market in February 2023, but that hasn't stopped us looking ahead to what the Samsung Galaxy S24 might bring to the mobile table next year. 
    Samsung’s latest flagships are three of the best phones money can buy right now (read our Samsung Galaxy S23 review, Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus review and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review to find out why), and early signs suggest that the next few entries in the brand’s popular S series will continue to push boundaries for mobile performance, photography, and battery life.
    Naturally, we’re still a while away from the release of the Samsung Galaxy S24 and its siblings, but we’ve nonetheless put together this one-stop-shop guide to all the latest news and rumors about Samsung’s next Galaxy S phones. "

      "Lightyear reveals new $40,000 solar-powered car, claims it will begin production in 2025","./images/ca1.jpg",
      "Jeremy Kaplan ",
      "Like pixies and pegasus, the idea of a solar-powered car is dreamy and perfect. Who wouldn’t want a car powered by the sun? Who doesn’t want to ditch the lines and bills at the gas station? This car can go up to 450 miles on a single charge, with solar panels covering five square meters of roof that can recover up to 12 km of range every hour. This car has four electric motors! This car … sounds almost too good to be true, doesn’t it? 

      The first-generation Lightyear 0 (go figure: the website is called lightyear.one) started production for the European market in December of 2022, the company claims, although video of the “production line” looks more like someone’s garage than a factory floor. (The company says the factory that makes A Class Mercedes will ultimately do the production.) 
      
      Now, at CES 2023, the company has unveiled the next-generation Lightyear 2 -- and no, we’re not sure what happened to version 1 either.
      \"All the learnings — and those are a lot — from Lightyear 0 we're applying to Lightyear 2,\" Alexandre Hoefsloot, CEO and Co-Founder of Lightyear, told me. But it's early days, and it takes a while to make a new car, much less one that's powered by the sun. \"This is still going to take two and a half years to get to production ... you know automotive. It takes a long time,\" he said."

      "Lance Ulanoff",
      "Three years after the introduction of its first Sony Electic Car Vision-S prototype, Sony and development partner Honda returned with a rebranded, but not necessarily more attractive, self-driving EV prototype.

      The newly branded 'Afeela' prototype rolled out onto the stage during Sony's CES 2023 press conference, where it was met by, if not excitement, then certainly curiosity.
      
      (Image credit: Future)
      The design is not much more traditional than the Vision-S, and less sporty, but it's no less intelligent.
      
      Sony says more than 45 sensors are arrayed around the body and inside of the car, although it's not clear if Sony and Honda are building a self-driving car or a mobile PlayStation 5 – Sony partner Unreal is using game graphics to build realistic environment simulations that, one would assume, the car can eventually use to help it navigate the real world."

      "There are several important things to keep in mind when searching for the best gaming laptops as they come in a variety of sizes, specs, and designs. And as such, we’ve put together a list of some of the top choices, all of which have been thoroughly tested to guarantee their quality and performance.

      Though the current cost of living crisis has driven up the cost of tech in general, that doesn't mean that it's harder to find the best gaming laptop for your needs and budget. The best laptop you're using to play PC games can cover the gambit between more expensive options with better specs or something more budget-minded with lower-end specs. And no matter what games you choose, the best cheap gaming laptops are sure to be able to handle them.
      
      For instance, the best thin and light gaming laptops are made to be extremely portable, while desktop replacement laptops are more powerful yet bulkier and heavier in return. Because of the difficulty of choosing between a desktop PC and a desktop replacement laptop, it’s important to compare the pros and cons of getting a gaming PC versus a gaming laptop, in order to see what works best for you."

      "The best smart lights can completely transform your home. Whether you fancy a warm, cozy ambience for a quiet night in, task lighting to light up your hobbies or lights that change along with your favourite TV shows, movies or games, there are smart bulbs and smart light panels for every kind of illumination. 

      The best smart light systems can also save you energy and money. Because they use LEDs they use a fraction of the electricity and generate a fraction of the heat of their incandescent equivalents – and that means they last much longer too. And they save your own energy too, because you can usually control them with your voice via the best smart speakers or best smart displays, with other best smart home devices and of course, with your phone.
      
      Smart lighting comes in all shapes and sizes, literally: in addition to smart bulbs there are lighting strips and geometric shapes, floor lamps and table lamps, downlighters and wall washers. If you can imagine it, there's a smart light that can do it.",

      "Your Ring camera features are about to change, and not in a good way","./images/sh2.jpg"
      ,"Cesar Cadenas",
      "Starting March 29, smart home brand Ring will begin requiring users to purchase a Ring Protect Plan for its devices as it’s placing several currently free features behind a paywall.

      On that day, owners of either a Ring doorbell or camera(opens in new tab) will lose access to Home and Away Modes on the official app and Amazon Alexa without a subscription. 
      
      Home Mode(opens in new tab), for those who don’t know, deactivates in-house sensors so people can move freely inside while keeping the ones outside a residence activated. Away Mode fully secures a house by arming all sensors and having the cameras constantly record; great for people who want to keep an eye on things while away. So as you can see, Ring is going to be charging people to use two of the more basic features. Not everything is changing, however. Other features like Two-Way Talk plus Motion Detection are staying free.",

      "We're expecting Apple to launch a MacBook Air with an OLED display in the next year or two, and the latest unconfirmed leak around the laptop suggests that it's going to arrive with a slightly smaller 13.4-inch display.

      That's according to well-respected industry analyst Ross Young(opens in new tab) (via MacRumors(opens in new tab)), who has previously said that this OLED MacBook Air is going to show up in 2024. Young adds that OLED-equipped MacBook Pros won't show up until 2024.
      
      Just a couple of days ago we covered a report that also pointed to 2024 as the year when this new product would arrive. Both Samsung and LG are apparently supplying the necessary OLED screens to Apple's manufacturing partners."
